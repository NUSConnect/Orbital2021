Orbital (Independent Software Development Project) is NUS School of Computing self-directed, independent work course. This programme gives students the opportunity to pick up software development skills on their own, using sources on the web. Our team members consist of Lua Yida and Benedict Chua.

**Proposed Level of Achievement:** Apollo 11

### Motivation

During the past year, we realised there are a growing number of students who have found it hard to make new friends in university, since lessons were all moved online due to COVID-19. This is a pain point for students, especially those who do not live on campus, as socialisation and meeting new people is an integral part of university life. 

Thus, we want to digitise the process of meeting new people, with the goal of making socialisation easy and accessible for students in a time where the COVID-19 pandemic has severely limited our ability to do so physically. 

### Aims

To help university students make friends and combat the social isolation due to COVID-19. 

We plan to make it a cross-platform mobile app, which users can download and register for. From there, we hope users will be able to use the app to seamlessly connect with new people, and form new interest groups based on a matching algorithm. We also aim to implement additional functionality to have native support for direct messaging and forums, so as to make the user experience as fuss-free and user-friendly as possible.

### Key Features:
* Social media features
* Messaging (supports Direct Messaging and Group Messaging)
* Forum (known as Portals in our application)
* Group-based Matching Algorithm (to be implemented)
* Pulling news of events happening in universities (to be implemented)

### Deployment:

Portal.io has been deployed for users to have a sneak preview of what the app entails. We will update the deployment as each milestone arrives so do keep an eye out for them! 

Simply download Expo Go on your mobile devices and scan the QR code blow to test out our app!

Note: iOS users will not be able to run the application out of the box due to restrictions on Expo put in place by Apple. If you want to test out the app, please contact us on Telegram for access.
